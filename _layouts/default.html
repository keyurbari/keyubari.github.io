The project served as my final project for Stanford CS 231n, \“Convolutional Neural Networks\”, a class I took Freshman year. The network’s task was to be able to learn the style of many artworks and be able to transfer the style onto any target image. Imagine the functionality of the app \"Prisma\", but instead of being restricted to a few paintings, the user could input any painting they like! As of the start of the project, it first time that the specific architecture had ever been attempted on this task.<br><br>I was able to achieve modest success on the novel architecture. I went through many weeks of tuning hyperparameters for experimentation and was able to get proof that the architecture does work. I wrote about the experiments and success in my final research-grade paper for the class, which can be found in the \”Writings\” section of the website.",

I then architected the high-level functionality of the app. Finally, I developed the entire architecture and design that I created. I published the app to the Google Play Store; it currently has a 4.9 star rating.",

I was recommended to pursue this project by a mentor at the Stanford AI Lab.<br><br>I initially developed the network using TensorFlow, but switched to PyTorch as I felt more familiar with that library. The network is current able to learn on the data, but is still unable to converge to what we call \”learning a language\”. I am current working on tuning the hyperparameters to make the network be able to translate between English and French.",

My contribution was to use a Recurrent Neural Network to predict future stock prices based on years of Nasdaq data. The trained network was able to take 30-days of stock performance data and predict the 31st day with modest accuracy.<br><br>The final product was a web app that integrated my contribution with other Machine Learning insights. Our app was submitted for consideration for the Nasdaq-sponsored prize, and we won. As a result, we were flown out to New York City to be given a tour of the Nasdaq building and studio. We even got a picture of us featured on a Time’s Square billboard, as shown in this site’s header image!",

After needfinding with the organization, we settled on developing a platform that mentors can use to share and find teaching materials. This creates a community focused on teaching, which is crucial for mentors who are just starting out.<br><br>The app was developed with a Node.js backend, an AngularJS frontend, and a Postgres database.
